    <p>Because every car deserves a second chance.</p>

    <h2>💔 The Problem</h2>
    <p>From classic beauties abandoned in barns to everyday workhorses suffering from years of wear and tear, too many cars are being mistreated or discarded prematurely. These vehicles often have plenty of life left—but lack the care, resources, or attention they need to thrive again.</p>

    <h2>💡 Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We raise funds to rescue, restore, and rehome cars in poor condition. Whether it's a vintage Mini Cooper or a humble hatchback, we work with mechanics, garages, and passionate volunteers to bring these vehicles back to life—and back on the road.</p>

    <h2>🌱 Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Saving cars isn’t just about nostalgia. It’s about sustainability, community, and preserving the stories that these vehicles carry. Every car we save reduces waste, supports skilled trades, and gives someone a reliable ride they can count on.</p>

    <h2>❤️ How You Can Help</h2>
